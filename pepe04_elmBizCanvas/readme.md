# Tribes 50

Tribes50 is an alpha version of Yet Another PM tool, based on (maybe) the following techniques: 

- **Tribes, squads, chapters and guilds** model, used by Spotify to execute Agile Projects at an Enterprise level 
  (for organization level Agility and/or big projects)
- **Kanban** boards for the squads, with stages and states within the stages. The stages are determined at the Tribe level
- **CFD** or cumulative flow diagram from Kanban reporting, with metrics by stages as well
- **Business Model canvas** for project definition, so everybody across the organization is aware of the product offerings
 
## Tech stack

So far, the following:

- Elm for the front end language
- Firebase, for the backend. A newer version may replace this with something that you can install locally (e.g. Phoenix+Ecto, RethinkDB)

## To do
This is an ongoing list of things to get done

### General
