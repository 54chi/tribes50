# TEST REPO

The painful but fun way of learning stuff that I have no experience about (yet):

1. Elixir (vs. Java and .Net)
2. Phoenix (vs. Rails and ASP.Net MVC)
3. Elm (vs. React and all things JavaScript)
4. Brunch (instead of webpack, gulp, grunt)
5. Mix (vs. Rake, Gradle, Maven and Ant)

## Updates:

- 3/25/2016: Created a simple OAuth2 authentication. Destroyed the next day
- 3/26/2016: Started looking into Elm stuff and the Phoenix+Trello example
- 3/27/2016: I couldn't make Elm and Phoenix like each other (I was using [this](https://medium.com/@diamondgfx/setting-up-elm-with-phoenix-be3a9f55bac2#.mvw1cgk06) as a base)
- 3/28/2016: I could make Elm and Phoenix like each other. It is basically [this](http://www.cultivatehq.com/posts/phoenix-elm-2/). Started studying a [cloned voting app](https://github.com/terakilobyte/phoenix-elm-webpack-example). Destroyed the Trello example (it was just the authentication piece so far anyways)
